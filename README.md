# QuizApp 🎮

QuizApp is a ReactJS-based web application that allows users to take assessments by solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The application ensures a seamless user experience with validations, scoring, and a final result display.

## ✨ Features
- **Interactive Quiz**: Users can solve MCQs one question at a time. 📝
- **Option Selection Validation**: Users cannot proceed to the next question without selecting an option. ❌➡️✅
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Scores are calculated in real-time using a score state variable. 💯
- **Final Score Display**: Once all questions are answered, users are presented with their final score. 📊
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a smooth and intuitive interface for taking quizzes. 👨‍💻👩‍💻

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Start the Quiz**: The quiz begins with the first question displayed on the screen. 🎬
2. **Option Selection**: Users must select an option to enable the "Next" button. 🦸‍♂️💬
    - If no option is selected, the user cannot proceed to the next question.
3. **Score Calculation**: The score is updated dynamically based on the correctness of the selected options. ➕➖
4. **Final Score**: Once the user completes all questions, the application displays the final score out of the total number of questions. 🏅

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: Frontend framework for building the user interface. ⚛️
- **State Management**: Managed using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. 🔄
- **CSS**: For styling the application. 🎨
